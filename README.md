# Space-Blasters

## :zap: About
This is a small, simple game made using the Godot Game Engine, similar to old-school arcade shooters! I hope you like it!

## :desktop_computer: How to run locally
I have not yet exported the project. So you'll need to run it using the Godot engine itself. Just clone the repository and import `project.godot` into the engine!

## :grey_question: Controls
- Move around with the left, right and up arrow keys
- Press `space` to shoot.
- Avoid enemies at all costs!
